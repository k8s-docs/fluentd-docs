This article explains how to install the
[td-agent](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/td-agent) rpm package,
the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/).

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive
parts written in C. However, some users may have difficulty installing
and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is
providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The
differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](https://www.fluentd.org/faqs).

This installation guide is for td-agent v3/td-agent 4.
td-agent v3/v4 uses fluentd v1 in the core. See [this page](/overview/td-agent-v2-vs-v3-vs-v4.md) for the comparison and supported OS.

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md) to configure
your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step 1: Install from rpm Repository

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up **ntpd** on the node to prevent
invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](/install/before-install.md).

Note: If td-agent doesn't support your OS, consider [gem installation](/install/install-by-gem.md) instead.

### Redhat / CentOS

Executing following shell script will automatically install td-agent on your machine.
This shell script registers a new rpm repository at `/etc/yum.repos.d/td.repo`
and installs the `td-agent` rpm package.

```
# td-agent 4
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent4.sh | sh
# td-agent 3
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

We use \$releasever for repository path in the script and \$releasever
should be only major version like \"7\". If your environment uses other
format like \"7.2\", change it to only major version or setup TD repository manually.

### Amazon Linux

For Amazon Linux 2.

```
# td-agent 4
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon2-td-agent4.sh | sh
# td-agent 3
$ curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-amazon2-td-agent3.sh | sh
```

## Step 2: Launch Daemon

td-agent provides 2 scripts:

### systemd

The `/usr/lib/systemd/system/td-agent` script is provided to start,
stop, or restart the agent.

```
$ sudo systemctl start td-agent.service
$ sudo systemctl status td-agent.service

Dec 07 15:12:27 ubuntu systemd[1]: Started td-agent: Fluentd based data collector for Treasure Data.
```

If you want to customize systemd behaviour, put your `td-agent.service` into `/etc/systemd/system`.

NOTE: In td-agent 4, path is different. `/opt/td-agent/bin` instead of `/opt/td-agent/embedded/bin`

### init.d

This is for CentOS 6, non systemd based system.

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
Starting td-agent: [  OK  ]
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
td-agent (pid  21678) is running...
```

The following commands are supported:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent status
```

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step 3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs
from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`).
You can post sample log records using the curl command.

```
$ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
```
