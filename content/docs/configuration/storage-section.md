Some of the Fluentd plugins support the `<storage>` section to specify how to
handle the plugin's internal states.

## Storage Section Overview

The **`storage`** section can be under `<source>`, `<match>` or `<filter>`
section. It is enabled for the plugins that support storage plugin features.

```
<source>
  @type windows_eventlog
  # ...
  <storage>
    # ...
  </storage>
</source>
```

## Storage Plugin Type

The `@type` parameter of `<storage>` section specifies the type of the storage
plugin. Fluentd core bundles [a useful storage
plugin](/plugins/storage/README.md).

```
<storage>
  @type local
</storage>
```

Some `storage` plugins may have argument(s) in `<storage>` section:

```
<storage awesome_path>
  @type local
</storage>
```

Third-party plugins may also be installed and configured.

For more details, see plugins documentation.
