Some of Fluentd plugins support the `<service_discovery>` section to set the
target nodes dynamically.

## Service Discovery Section Overview

The **`service_discovery`** section comes under `<match>`.

```
<match tag.*>
  @type forward
  # ...
  <service_discovery>
    # ...
  </service_discovery>
</match>
```

## Service Discovery Plugin Type

The `@type` parameter of `<service_discovery>` section specifies the type of the
plugin. Fluentd core bundles [some useful service discovery
plugins](/plugins/service_discovery/README.md) e.g. `file`.

```
<service_discovery>
  @type file
  # ...
</service_discovery>
```

Here's the list of built-in service discovery plugins:

- [`static`](/plugins/service_discovery/static.md)
- [`file`](/plugins/service_discovery/file.md)
- [`srv`](/plugins/service_discovery/srv.md)

For more details, see plugins documentation.

### `@type`

The `@type` parameter specifies the type of the service discovery plugin.

```
<service_discovery>
  @type static
  # ...
</service_discovery>
```
